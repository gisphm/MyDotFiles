My Vagrant Dot Files
============

vimrc* is based on [spf13-vim][1], an awesome and wonderful repo for vim bundles.

zshrc and gitconfig are based on [oh-my-zsh][2], a beautiful and greate repo for
using zsh.
That zsh theme is based on agnoster theme. I modified something in it so that it
fits me.

gemrc contains nothing but mirror of taobao and installing gems without docs.
